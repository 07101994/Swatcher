# swatcher
      The only FileSystemWatcher package that really works! No false positives, no fuss and a simple, intuitive API.
      
      The package can be installed in your project via nuget using:
      Install-Package Swatcher
      
      The HelloWorld solution contains two projects: one for consuming a Swatcher via events and a second one that shows how to consume a Swatcher using Rx observables.
      
      I will be working on the wiki over the next few weeks.
      You may contact me via email martin@mizzellconsulting.com in the interim if you have any questions.
      
      FULL DISCLOSURE: This is a beta version of a product that will be commercialized once it has been run through the paces with the public. That said, I'm not placing any restrictions in the beta assemblies and license is hereby granted to use with those versions for as long as you so desire.
