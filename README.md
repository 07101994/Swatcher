# swatcher
      The only FileSystemWatcher package that really works! No false positives, no fuss and a simple, intuitive API.
      
      The package can be installed in your project via nuget using:
      Install-Package Swatcher
      
      A very simple example app has been uploaded to the dev branch that uses .Net events to consume a Swatcher. (8-21-16)
      Another example app will be uploaded in the next few days that uses reactive extensions to consume a Swatcher.
