    <summary>
      Reliable, real-time file system monitoring with an intuitive API that developers everywhere love. Swatcher' external API was made to feel similar to FileSystemWatcher so the learning curve is very low. Under the hood, however, it's a completely different story! 500 development hours have been invested in creating the fastest, most reliable file system monitoring possible via IOCompletionPorts and Reactive Extensions.
